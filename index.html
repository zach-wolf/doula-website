                        <p><br>Hey there - I'm Caitlin (Cait)! I'm a wife, a mama, a Jacksonville native, and a <a href="https://www.birthbelongstowomen.com/" target="_blank">Birth Belongs to Women™</a> certified doula. I serve families throughout Jacksonville and the beaches, and I'm currently living beachside with my sweet little family. I adore motherhood, I love being married to my best friend, and I serve as the missions director at my church. I’m a lover of Jesus, the sun and sea, good food, and intentional living.<br>
                           <br>My heart for birth started young, but that deepened and grew into something sacred during my own pregnancy. I immersed myself in education, connected with wise women, and was beautifully supported by my doula. I witnessed firsthand the power of presence, education, and encouragement - and I knew I was being called to offer that to others.<br>
                           <br>I believe birth is a divine design - sacred, powerful, and transformative. As your doula, I’ll walk with you through pregnancy, birth, and postpartum with support that is grounded, respectful, and deeply personal. I want to hear your heart, your hopes, fears, and dreams - because <i>if it matters to you, it matters to me.</i><br>
                           <br>Whether this is your first baby or your fifth, I would be honored to walk this sacred road alongside you.<br>
                           <br>Ready to connect? Schedule your complimentary consultation today - I can’t wait to meet you!</p>

                        <p><br>I chose the name <b><i>Sisterhood</i></b> because that’s what I believe birth was always meant to include - a circle of women, a sense of belonging, and support that runs deeper than instruction.<br>
                           <br>For generations, birth was shared in homes, among mothers, daughters, sisters, and friends. It was sacred. Whether you're planning a homebirth, hospital birth, or birth center experience, I believe that spirit of sisterhood still matters - and I’ve seen how much it changes a woman’s experience when she knows she’s not alone.<br>
                           <br>As your doula, I don’t show up as the expert - I show up as your sister. Someone to listen, pray, encourage, and advocate. Someone who will hold space for your story and remind you that <i>you were made for this.</i><br>
                           <br>I’ll offer evidence-based education, emotional support, and hands-on guidance - but also gentle reminders of who you are and how capable your body is. You don’t have to do this alone. That’s the beauty of sisterhood - and the heart behind all I do.<br>
                           <br>Having grown up here in Jacksonville and now raising my own family by the beach, I understand the unique rhythm of our coastal community. There's something special about supporting families where the salt air meets sacred beginnings.</p>

                            A doula is a trained professional who offers emotional, physical, and educational support before, during, and after birth. I’m not a medical provider - I don’t perform clinical tasks - but I am a steady, grounded presence in one of the most sacred seasons of your life.
                            <br><br>As your doula, I walk with you through pregnancy, labor, and postpartum - offering encouragement, advocacy, and practical care along the way. Whether you’re preparing for your first birth or your fourth, you don’t have to do it alone. I’ll be in your corner every step of the way.
                            <br><br>This is more than a service - it’s a calling. A deep desire to hold space for women in their most powerful and vulnerable moments, and to remind you of what you were made to do.

It’s about having someone beside you who truly sees you, hears you, and stays with you.
                            <br><br>I’m here to walk with you through it all - helping you prepare with confidence, offering grounded support during labor, and holding space for your heart and body as you adjust and heal in the postpartum days.
                            <br><br>I don’t take the place of your partner - I come alongside them. Your partner knows you. I know birth. Together, we make a steady, trusted team to surround you with care, encouragement, and strength.
                            <br><br>Whether you’re birthing at home, in a hospital, or somewhere in between - you don’t have to carry this alone. I’m in it with you.

                            <b>Choose Birth Prep Package if:</b> You're looking for solid birth preparation and confidence-building. Maybe this isn't your first baby, or you have strong support from family or friends, but you want professional guidance to feel prepared and empowered.

You value having me available for questions and want that postpartum check-in, but you feel confident about your birth support team.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Choose Birth Doula Package if:</b> You want the full doula experience - someone to be with you through labor and delivery, unlimited support throughout pregnancy, and extended care into those early weeks of motherhood. This is ideal if you're a first-time mom, want continuous labor support, or simply desire the most comprehensive care.

My goal is to help you feel informed, empowered, and deeply supported - no matter the setting. We’ll go over your birth preferences together and talk through how to create a peaceful and supported environment, even within the hospital system.

                            <br><br>There are many ways to make your cesarean more gentle and honoring of your desires. We can discuss options like delayed cord clamping, immediate skin-to-skin, dim lighting, a personal playlist, or even clear drapes if your provider allows. These things matter, and you still have a voice in your birth story.

                            <br><br>We can still work through different labor positions (yes, even with an epidural!) to encourage progress and keep your body aligned for birth. There’s also so much more to support - your environment, mindset, communication with your care team, informed decision-making, and your partner’s experience too.
                            <br><br>My role is never to steer you toward one kind of birth - it’s to walk with you through your birth, offering presence, wisdom, and encouragement every step of the way.
